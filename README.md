A set of collections for C# made for purpose of Windows Phone Development.
This library is highly experimental and not usable at the moment. It will 
soon be, however :).

BinaryHeap is now prepared for use! Math package was added, containing stubs 
of Complex and Matrix classes for (suprisingly) complex + matrix computation.
Some operations are not yet supported, but most of the casual operators like
+,/,-,* are overloaded so it is now easier to work with comp + mtx. Determinant
computation supported as well!
