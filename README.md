Updates:
-------
* 06/11/2012 - 
Minor mistakes in binomial heap implementation corrected. Binomial heap 
implementation is working now!

* 05/11/2012 - 
Binomial heap implemented. To be tested properly.

* 02/11/2012 - 
BinomialHeap is being implemented! Work in progress version with implemented
Add is prepared. Merging soon!

* 27/10/2012 -
BinaryHeap is now prepared for use! Math package was added, containing stubs 
of Complex and Matrix classes for (suprisingly) complex + matrix computation.
Some operations are not yet supported, but most of the casual operators like
+,/,-,* are overloaded so it is now easier to work with comp + mtx. Determinant
computation supported as well!
